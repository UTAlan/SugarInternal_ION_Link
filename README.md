These extensions for Chrome and Firefox will allow you to easily access the "On-Demand Account URL" from the Case Detail View in SugarInternal.

Additionally, there's a configurable option to give you a javascript confirm() alert box if you attempt to create a note on a case that has no portal submitter.

To install on Chrome, go to Tools > Extensions, then drag and drop the .crx file onto the page.

To install on Firefox, go to Tools > Add-ons, then click the gear in the top right corner and choose "Install Add-on from File...". Find and choose the .xpi file.
